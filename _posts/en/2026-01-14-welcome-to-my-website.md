Hello everyone! Welcome to my personal website. This site is built using Jekyll and the Minimal Mistakes theme.

- **Personal Branding**: Building your professional identity
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Helping others learn from your experiences
- **Portfolio Display**: Showing your projects and achievements
- **Communication Platform**: Connecting with like-minded people

## Technology Stack

- **Jekyll**: Static site generator
- **Minimal Mistakes**: Responsive Jekyll theme
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting
- **Markdown**: Content writing

## Features

This website includes:
- Blog posts and technical articles
- CV and resume
- Project showcase
- Social sharing functionality
- Multi-language support

## Future Plans

I plan to continuously update this website with:
- More technical tutorials
